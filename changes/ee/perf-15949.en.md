Change listener config default value for `parse_unit` from `chunk` to `frame`.
This should significantly lower CPU usage when payload is greater than socket buffer (default = 4KB).

Note: with `parse_unit=frame` when a `PUBLISH` packet is too large, EMQX will close connection instead of sending a `DISCONNECT` packet.
