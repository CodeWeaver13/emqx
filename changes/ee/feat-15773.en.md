Throttle client ID registration during reconnects

Added throttling for client ID registration if the previous session cleanup is still in progress.
This prevents instability when clients reconnect aggressively with the same client ID.
Affected clients will receive reason code `133` (Client Identifier not valid) in `CONNACK`.
Clients should retry after the previous session cleanup has completed.
