Fix a bug in the component overseeing Mria replication that could cause stuck or incomplete cluster joins in core-replicant clusters.

During cluster changes involving adding new core nodes, said core nodes could sometimes fail to start replication-related processes that replicants rely on. This in turn caused upgraded or newly added replicant nodes to hang on startup. In Kubernetes deployments, this led to the controller repeatedly restarting replicant pods due to failing readiness probes.

Typical upgrade rollouts, such as adding two new cores and two new replicants running a newer EMQX release to an existing 2-core + 2-replicant cluster, could be affected.
