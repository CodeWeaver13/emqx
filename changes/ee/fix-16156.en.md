Fixed an issue where some dependencies lost some default configurations compared to EMQX 5.10.

This could lead to problems related to RSA signing.  For example, the following could be seen in the logs:

```
{sign_unsupported,[[{rsa_padding,rsa_pkcs1_padding}]]}, [{jose_jwa_unsupported,verify,5,[{file,"src/jwa/jose_jwa_unsupported.erl"},{line,55}]}
```
