Added support to perform rolling upgrade from EMQX Enterprise base version 5.8.0 and newer to 6.0, in which older configurations are upgraded to newer formats supported by 6.0.  In particular, the `bridges` deprecated configuration root is converted to the newer `connectors`, `sources` and `actions` configuration roots.

The following Sources will still manual changes:

- GCP PubSub Consumer and Kafka Consumer: if there are any such sources in the configuration that still contain the `topic_mapping` field, the field must be removed from config and then one Source + Rule pair must be created for each entry.
